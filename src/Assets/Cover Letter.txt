Dear Sir,

I went through the job description and found a few requirements that I don't meet.  I have devoted my last 7 months to 2000+ hours of coding gaining from no knowledge to having a good understanding and knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I have also created various projects in this field and currently also working on a full-stack project. I may lack experience but am quite confident that if given an opportunity I'd exceed expectations. 
I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and further discuss my qualifications and your requirements in detail. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
 
 Sincerely,
Saroj Kumar Pahi
